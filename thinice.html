    <h1>A continuation</h1>

    <p>
        Momma loves her baby<br>
        And daddy loves you too.<br>
        And the sea may look warm to you babe<br>
        And the sky may look blue<br>
        Ooooh <br>
        Ooooh baby blue<br>
        Oooooh babe.<br><br>

        If you should go skating<br>
        On the thin ice of modern life<br>
        Dragging behind you the silent reproach<br>
        Of a million tear-stained eyes<br>
        Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice<br>
        Appears under your feet.<br>
        You slip out of your depth and out of your mind<br>
        With your fear flowing out behind you<br>
        As you claw the thin ice.<br>
        </p>
